People loves to share the foods they love in social media platforms today, and by labeling these food images could help the platforms plan better advertising projection and increase the metrics such as click through rate for adversting.

In this project, we would like to utilize CNN to build a food classifcation model with several deep learning optimization skills like augmentation, semi-supervised, and pre-trained model applications.
